### I love experimenting!
As I complete my B.S. in Computer Science, I want to continue to establish my skills as a developer, focusing on cloud and internet technologies. In addition to improving what is already in my portfolio, some topics I hope to explore next are:
- Angular.js and Typescript
- C++ (past the fundamentals)
- React
