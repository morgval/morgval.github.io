### I love experimenting with new technologies!
As I complete my B.S. in Computer Science, I want to continue to establish my skills as a developer, focusing on cloud and internet technologies. In addition to improving what is already in my portfolio as I progress, some topics I hope to explore next are:
- Angular.js and Typescript
- C++ (past the fundamentals)
- React
- Cybersecurity

## Code Review
As apart of the completion of my degree program, I need to select one to three projects that best represent my skills and what I have learned over the course of my two year study.  I unfortunately did not have access to the complete extent of my degree projects (my desktop computer is stored as I am moving) but I chose two projects that showed my ability to work with new technologies and understand the frameworks already establsihed.  This final project also required me to perform a code review before making modifications.
